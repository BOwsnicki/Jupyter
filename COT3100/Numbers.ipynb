    "\n",
    "From any introductory programming course it’s well-known that the two standard number representations – for fixed and for floating point numbers – are based on the allocation of a fixed, finite amount of storage for a number. That’s usually measured in bits, such 16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that fixed point numbers, generally called “Integers” (here with a capital “I” to distinguish them from the mathematical “integers” – the numbers in ℤ) can overflow – either by abruptly changing the sign if they are “signed” or switching from a large value to 0 if they are “unsigned”.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point (“Floats”) have a limited mantissa space and limited exponent space. That results in overflow behavior and additionally rounding problems if the mantissa space isn’t sufficient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both aspects of these representations are theoretically and practically problematic – especially floating-point numbers show behavior that doesn’t comply with mathematical principles at all: \n",
    "1. Even rational numbers are represented in this format, meaning that as soon as a number has a “long” or infinite decimal part, it cannot be represented accurately\n",
    "1. The “normal” arithmetic rules don’t apply to Floats, at least not ideally. So, numerical stability is a severe issue  \n",
